# Advent of Code 2021

I have the `tsc` compiler installed as a dev dependancy; To setup this repository, do the following steps:

> Edit the start command in `package.json` to run a specific file


```bash
yarn # or npm i 
yarn watch # to begin compiling code
yarn start # to run compiled js file
```
